# FConsole
FConsole is a bunch* of useful debug tools for speeding up development process.

*Inspired by [Flash-Console](https://github.com/junkbyte/flash-console)*

* Actually, there are only 2 implemented features yet (up to the August 29, 2016): Display List Inspector and Properties Editing. In my opinion, these two are the most useful and important features from [Flash-Console](https://github.com/junkbyte/flash-console) and I wanted to implement them the first.
